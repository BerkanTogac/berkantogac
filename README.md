ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Berkan!

ðŸŒ± After completing intensive bootcamps in Python, JavaScript, and AWS through Clarusway, ranked among the top 10 by Forbes, I'm diving headfirst into the world of IT.

ðŸ‘€ I'm exploring Terraform and Docker and next one is Kubernetes, seeking to deepen my understanding of infrastructure orchestration and containerization.

ðŸ”­ My passion lies in crafting secure and scalable VPC environments, merging my love for diving with the depths of IT infrastructure.

ðŸ’¬ I'm eager to collaborate on innovative projects that challenge the status quo of cloud computing and DevOps methodologies, utilizing my skills in Python, JavaScript, and AWS.
